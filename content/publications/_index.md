This page represents the landing page for "publications" section. It is also shown under the homepage header for "publications". It should be therefore relatively short and sweet.

\-->

This section is still under construction, but there are two publications I have contributed to:

1. HIL Temperature Control
2. BFGEval Battery Fuel Gauge Evaluation

*Note*: both of these are through Research at the University of Windsor; I implemented test platforms for the masters' students, and if needed (on the above cases), I write a section in their thesis about the implementation.
