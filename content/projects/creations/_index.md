This page represents the landing page for "creations" section. It is also shown under the homepage header for "creations". It should be therefore relatively short and sweet.

On my spare time, I always choose working on a personal project over playing video games. As such, I have a *large* number of personal projects that will be in here, although I have not had the time to get to it, thanks to *other responsibilities*.

A (relatively) short list of the most notable projects is:

1. Electric Motorcycle
   - Ground-up, from scratch, design and assembly of an electric motorcycle.
   - Done on a YZ125 Dirtbike frame
   - "Ground Up" meaning everything, right down to the charging circuit, was hand-assembled on custom PCBs, using individual parts from DigiKey.
2. Electric Longboards
   - After COVID hit, my motor supplier for the Electric Motorcycle flaked out, and since that was the last component I was waiting on, I gutted the bike to make three Electric Boards on the cheap.
   - Since then, the boards have completely transformed into offroad performance vehicles, also with a custom design.
   - Open-source ESC, dual drive, custom longboard deck, and *hand-assembled batteries* are the notable features. Assembling batteries by hand is very time-consuming, but is a third the cost of pre-assembled cells.
   - ~30km range (in summertime)
   - Telemetry and logging, speed limiting, current control, range estimation, total draw, and more are tracked by the controller and displayed on an LCD screen on the hand-held remote.
3. Home Server
   - This one is a little less impressive, but I host a home server with containerized services.
   - Running Ubuntu Server 22.04
   - Plex, OpenVPN, Nextcloud, Minecraft, qBitTorrent, HandBrake/FileBot, a code server, and more are hosted for both friends and I.
   - Daily backup scripts for anything remotely important
   - Mostly this is so I can host my own services and hold all my own data, rather than using *large companies*
4. A lot more projects done from (mostly) scratch, because programming and EE is cool
   - 3D Printing
   - Racing drones
   - Lots of PC builds
   - Custom motorcycles (wiring, fabrication, etc)
   - Farming (family farm)
   - FPV RC car/planes/drones
   - I do all my own maintenance on motorcycles, cars, diesel tractors, etc
   - A series of concurrency projects and other small programming ventures
   - C and Python are the preferred languages, I am very proficient in C specifically, for low level embedded applications
   - A *lot* of small Arduino projects to automate silly tasks, for one-off uses for parties, etc
   - And more, but I will finish this section another day. Toodaloo!
