description: "Uses an Arduino to control a custom electric motorcycle. Safety features include a kill switch, brake light, and speedometer. Range estimation is provided by a custom algorithm that uses a current sensor and voltage sensor to estimate battery capacity. Electronics are completely custom, including a custom PCB and custom firmware."

- Programmed and assembled an electric dirt-bike.
- Assembled using an Arduino Mega for control with C++, a touchscreen display, custom aluminum panels, isolated inputs and outputs, and all-custom power distribution and analog sensing, mounted on a stripped frame.
- This project was my capstone for Electronics Engineering Technology.
- Features included:
- Fully-fleshed out faults
- A fully-custom, hand-wired analog amplifier stack for telemetry
- A fully-custom, switching charging circuit. (note: I only had a 4S charger and this system runs at 24S, so a switching relay circuit changes the cell layout with the press of a button!)
- Safety features
- A touchscreen display with speed, telemetry, range estimation, faults, and all the normal indicators you would get on a motorcycle!
- Every single system on this bike was built by hand, from the ground-up!
