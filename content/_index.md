The most recent iteration of my Resume can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colefuerth/Resumes/main/resume.pdf)!

I am an Embedded Engineer that dabbles in (almost) every field I can! I would *always* prefer working on a project using a cool new concept I learned over video games any day. My native languages are C and Python for Embedded and Machine Learning respectively, but I pick up most concepts very quickly, and start integrating every skill I can into my projects.

- I love EVs and anything robotics related
- I have built an EV platform from scratch using custom PCBs as my Electronics Engineering Capstone
- I graduated from Honours Computer Science (AI Specialization) with distinction and a math minor from the University of Windsor
- I have a lot of experience doing contracts on small to medium projects for both the University and a string of private contracts
- I am currently learning high performance concurrency in Rust by building a [concurrent ping engine](https://github.com/colefuerth/wasping). The goal is to make a giant poster of a pixel map of which IPs respond and which ones don't
