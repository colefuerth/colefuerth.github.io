I am an Embedded Engineer that dabbles in (almost) every field I can! I would *always* prefer working on a project using a cool new concept I learned over video games any day. My native languages are C and Python for Embedded and Machine Learning respectively, but I pick up most concepts very quickly, and start integrating every skill I can into my projects. Some more details about me:

- I love EVs and anything robotics related. Embedded systems are my bread and butter, but I would also like to explore the field of Software Engineering, as it would mesh well with my knowledge of both Embedded and Machine Learning.
- I have been playing with electronics and making things with my skills since I was 7, when I got an [Electronic Playground](https://shop.elenco.com/consumers/electronic-playground-130.html) for Christmas and rushed through all of the projects and questions in the book.
- [Mathew Pellarin](https://github.com/matp101) and I won first place in the Emulators category at [CSGames 2023](http://2023.csgames.org/)! We also entered in the Machine Learning and Extreme Programming categories for our university, but did not place.
- I have built an EV platform from scratch using custom PCBs as my Electronics Engineering Capstone
- I graduated with a Bachelors of Honours Computer Science (AI Specialization) with distinction and a math minor from the University of Windsor, as well as an Electronics Engineering degree from St. Clair College.
- I am currently learning high performance concurrency in Rust by building a [concurrent ping engine](https://github.com/colefuerth/wasping). The goal is to make a giant poster of a pixel map of which IPs respond and which ones don't
- I like motorcycling, electric boarding, rock climbing, coffee, and video games! Most of my hobbies have a DIY component to them, and I love to learn new skills.
- I grew up on a small family farm, where I learned to work with my hands and gained a lot of technical skills. I can (competently) operate all of the heavy equipment, fix the machines in the field, and I am responsible for most of the electrical diagnostics and repairs for everything here. I paired this experience with my Electronics Engineering and Computer Science degrees to make a lot of cool projects. Engines are cool, too!
- I have a lot of experience completing contracts on small to medium projects for both the University and a string of private contracts.
